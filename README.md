# Comet KVM Plugin

| | |
|---|---|
| **This repo** | [`Coldaine/comet-kvm-codex-plugin`](https://github.com/Coldaine/comet-kvm-codex-plugin) |
| **Forked from** | [`kennypeh85/glkvm-mcp`](https://github.com/kennypeh85/glkvm-mcp) (upstream MCP server) |
| **Relationship** | Selective fork — occasionally review upstream for bug fixes, but this repo diverges strongly and is its own project |

This repository develops and ships a **Comet KVM MCP server** for physical-machine operation and recovery, packaged for Codex as a plugin. Its primary path is console/HID, screenshots and OCR, power/WOL where available, virtual media, appliance diagnostics, and private remote access. BIOS-aware tools remain available as a separate specialist lane; they are not a prerequisite for ordinary Comet work. Not VM orchestration or general-purpose remote desktop.

**Primary distribution target: Codex.** The MCP server itself is usable from any MCP client; Codex packaging is first. See [`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`](docs/NORTH_STAR.md) for goals.

---

## What ships where

A Codex plugin is an installable bundle. For this project that bundle is:

| Plugin payload | Role |
|---|---|
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Manifest — identity + pointers |
| `.mcp.json` | How Codex launches **this repo's** MCP server |
| `.claude/skills/` | General Comet operations and specialized BIOS driver playbooks |
| `glkvm_mcp.py` + `src/` | The MCP server implementation the launcher runs |

That is the whole plugin shape: **your MCP + skill(s)**. It is not a thin wrapper around upstream. Upstream (`kennypeh85/glkvm-mcp`) was the starting fork; this tree owns and augments the server.

### Not part of the plugin

These live in the repo for development and local agent work. They are **not** Codex plugin components:

| Repo surface | Role |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Thin router into `docs/` for developer agents working *in* this repo |
| `docs/` | Project authority and design docs |
| `scripts/`, `tests/`, `extras/` | Local tooling, tests, preserved upstream helpers |

`AGENTS.md` is a thin router into `docs/` (Codex loads it from the repo). Skills are workflows. MCP is tools. The plugin packages skills + MCP — not `AGENTS.md`.

### Manifest

`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` points at the plugin payload only:

```json
{
  "skills": "./.claude/skills/",
  "mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"
}
```

`.mcp.json` starts `glkvm_mcp.py` via `uv run --locked --python 3.13 python ./glkvm_mcp.py`. The server code that runs is this project's — `kvm_core` plus `bios_sidecar` (loaded by default; set `COMET_DISABLE_BIOS_SIDECAR=1` to skip) on one `FastMCP("comet-kvm")` process. `kvm_connect` resolves an omitted password through the Doppler CLI; the launcher does not inject secret environment variables. Dependency direction is one-way: sidecar may depend on KVM core, not vice versa.

---

## Current Scope

The **core** is the universal KVM MCP server: transport, session/auth, HID,
screenshots/OCR, media, appliance control, and plugin packaging. That is the
normal route for a Comet task.

The **firmware specialist lane** is the BIOS sidecar: cartography, navigation,
mutation, and optional HWiNFO-backed validation for a named machine. It is
entered only for an explicit firmware request and does not gate the core
product. Board-specific procedure lives in `.claude/skills/comet-bios-triage/`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) installed on the host
- A GL.iNet Comet Pro (GL-RM10) or PiKVM-compatible device on your LAN (firmware 1.9.0+)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for running the MCP server
- [Doppler CLI](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli) configured for `homelab/dev` when using the bundled plugin launcher

### Install Tesseract

```bash
# Windows
choco install tesseract-ocr

# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

### Use in Codex

The plugin is auto-discovered when the repo is installed as a Codex plugin. Its bundled launcher runs `uv run --locked --python 3.13 python ./glkvm_mcp.py`. `kvm_connect` fetches `GLCOMET_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the Doppler CLI (`doppler.yaml`); the host must have Doppler installed and authenticated.

**Launcher note:** The bundled [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) does not wrap the process in `doppler run` for env injection. Doppler CLI auth on the host is required for password resolution. A future portable credential-elicitation path remains a candidate in [`docs/plans/02-mcp-v2-migration-evaluation.md`](docs/plans/02-mcp-v2-migration-evaluation.md).

### Use as a standalone MCP server

Add to any MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "comet-kvm": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/repo", "--locked", "--python", "3.13", "python", "./glkvm_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Tools

### Connection
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kvm_connect(host?, password?, username?, target?, force_reconnect?)` | Optional override — device tools auto-connect to the managed default; a matching live session returns `reused: true`. Omitted password is fetched from Doppler CLI (`GLCOMET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and cached in-process |
| `kvm_disconnect(target?)` | Close one target or all sessions (non-sticky: the next device tool reconnects the default) |
| `kvm_select_target(target)` | Select the active multi-Comet target |
| `kvm_status()` | Report connection state, managed defaults, capture diagnostics, held keys, and targets — never connects |

### Keyboard
| Tool | Description |

See [`docs/kvm-core.md`](docs/kvm-core.md) for the BIOS interaction lifecycle.

### Deprecated Aliases

The `comet_raw_*` aliases currently duplicate `kvm_*` tools. They are deprecated in documentation only; the tools still exist and removal is a future code task.

```

The GL.iNet 1.9 web UI's **Text Recognition** button is a separate
Tesseract.js/WASM worker running in the controlling browser. It is not executed
by the Comet and is not callable by this Python MCP process. The inherited
PiKVM `/api/streamer/ocr` route is retained only as a discovery observation;
the MCP does not treat it as the product UI OCR backend.

The MCP server maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to the Comet for low-latency keyboard/mouse input, and uses HTTP for screenshots, authentication, ATX, sysinfo, and MSD upload. It runs background key-watchdog and WebSocket-pinger loops.

Runtime logs go to stderr and to the rotating file `state/logs/comet-kvm.log`. Set `COMET_LOG_LEVEL` or `COMET_LOG_DIR` to override the default level or directory.

See [`docs/kvm-core.md`](docs/kvm-core.md) for the KVM core architecture and [`docs/reference/comet-api.md`](docs/reference/comet-api.md) for verified Comet API details.

---

## Security

- **LAN only** — designed for trusted local networks
- **TLS verification disabled** — the Comet ships with a self-signed certificate
- **No credentials stored** — password is passed per-session or fetched from Doppler CLI (`GLCOMET_ADMIN_PASSWORD` only)
- **Remote access** — use Tailscale (native on Comet) or VPN; do not expose the MCP server's stdio to an untrusted network

---

## Firmware Bug Fixes

This server includes fixes for known GLKVM/PiKVM firmware bugs:
- **Stuck key / double-typing** (firmware <= 1.9.0): every character sent as atomic keydown -> 25ms -> keyup(finish=true)
- **Modifier release order bug** (gl-inet/glkvm #22): modifiers wrap strictly outside the main key
- **Stale key watchdog**: auto-releases any key held >250ms

---

## Upstream Relationship

This repo is a selective fork of [`kennypeh85/glkvm-mcp`](https://github.com/kennypeh85/glkvm-mcp):

- **Upstream** is a standalone MCP server for GLKVM/Comet keyboard/mouse/screenshot/OCR.
- **This repo** ships its **own** MCP server (forked code under `src/`, composed by `glkvm_mcp.py`), augments it (BIOS sidecar, host OCR, Comet hardware tools, etc.), and packages that server for Codex with skills.

We are not wrapping upstream as an external dependency. We keep a fetch-only `upstream` remote to cherry-pick bug fixes or API improvements when useful. This repo is not a mirror and does not track upstream releases.

Helpers that lived at upstream's repo root (calibration, click helper, stuck-key userscript) are preserved in [`extras/`](extras/) — useful, not plugin payload.
